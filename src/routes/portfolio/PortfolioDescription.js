      I have dedicated considerable time to various projects. I have been fortunate to be part of a holistic 
      academic curriculum that not only provides a strong theoretical foundation but also emphasises practical workshops, 
      projects, and quizzes. Each project is a testament to my passion for creating impactful and innovative solutions.
